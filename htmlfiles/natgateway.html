            Private App Subnets and Private Data Subnets are not connected to Public Route Table that is connected to the internet gateway.
            So the next step is to create NAT gateways for the two Availability Zones.
            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html" target="_blank">Network Address Translation gateway</a>
            (NAT gateway) is used for instances in a private subnet to be able to connect ot services outside VPC.
            I first created a public NAT gateway in each Public Subnet with the two Availavility Zones with 
            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html" target="_blank">Elastic IP address</a>
            (EIP). This would automatically allocate an EIP for the public NAT gateways. 
            <br><br>

            I then added a private route table for each Availability Zone. 
            The destination of the route tables are 0.0.0.0/0 and the target is NAT gateway for each Availability Zone. 
            After that, I associated each private route table to Private App Subnet and Private Data Subnet for each Availability Zone.

                Public Subnet AZ1 and Public Subnet AZ2 are associated with Public Route Table with a route to the Dev Internet Gateway.
                Private Data Subnet AZ1 and Private App Subnet AZ1 are associated with Private Route Table AZ1, whose target is NAT Gateway AZ1.
                Private Data Subnet AZ2 and Private App Subnet AZ2 are associated with Private Route Table AZ2, whose target is NAT Gateway AZ2.
